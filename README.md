# IOT-Based-Medication-Monitorig-System-for-Independently-Living-Patients
This project is an IoT-based medication monitoring system designed to help caregivers monitor medication adherence remotely. It integrates an ESP32, a Raspberry Pi, a camera monitoring system, and an IR sensor to track medication usage. The system captures real-time video, stores it, and sends email alerts to caregivers if medication is missed.
Usage
The IR sensor detects when medication is taken.
The camera records video and stores it in the system.
If medication is not taken on time, an email alert is sent to the caregiver.
